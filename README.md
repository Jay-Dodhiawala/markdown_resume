# How to Host Markdown Resume.

## Purpose.

This guide is going to help in creating and showcasing the resume on a staic website using different tools. This resume file will be written in markdown, therefore you will need a markdown editor to produce it, as well as a GitHub page to host it and Jekyll to format it. This will also include the principles and ideas presented in Andrew Etter's book Modern Technical Writing, which we will appy step-by-step tutorial on how to create, formate, and host your resume.

## Prerequisites.

This are the requirement to follow the step-by-step instruction for thios project:

- **Markdown Editor -** You will required a markdown editor like [Markdown Pad](http://www.markdownpad.com/) which is suggested by Andrrew Etter in the book. But it is not limited to Markdown Pad as you can use any markdown of your choice to showcase that we will use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) editor for this project.
- **Your Markdown Resume -** You would have to create your resume in light weight markup language preferabilly mardown as it is simple and widely used using any Markdown Editor. Visit this [link](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/) for the tutorial on Markdown.
- **Github Account -** You would require a [github](https://github.com/?ef_id=_k_EAIaIQobChMIn7L4t9LjhAMVvYzCCB0ZnwBEEAAYASAAEgL85PD_BwE_k_&OCID=AIDcmmli8vlwie_SEM__k_EAIaIQobChMIn7L4t9LjhAMVvYzCCB0ZnwBEEAAYASAAEgL85PD_BwE_k_&gad_source=1&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIn7L4t9LjhAMVvYzCCB0ZnwBEEAAYASAAEgL85PD_BwE) account where you can create, store, manage your resume online. GitHub is an version control platform which is widely used by the developers to store, collborate on the code/project.
- **Jekyll -** [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) renders markdown file and add theme to it and produce a complete static website ready to be served.

## Instructions.

### 1. Make Resume in Markdown.

To create a professional resume locally for hosting on a static website, we'll utilize a lightweight markup language. Markdown, being one of the most widely used lightweight markup languages, aligns perfectly with our goals. By employing Markdown, we adhere to Andrew Etter's principle of simplicity and accessibility, as outlined in his book "Modern Technical Writing."

**Note - Your resume file name should be `index.md`_(this is important step)_.**

<!-- ### 2. Install Git
Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/) on your computer, as it offers superior performance and is widely favored by technical writers as a distributed version control system (DVCS). -->

### 2. Create GitHub Account.

GitHub is widely regarded as one of the most popular Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS) on the market. Using DVCS such as GitHub keeps track of all the version of the project and making it available and allowing users to quickly repair errors or make modifications. Etter emphasizes the benefits of usingÂ DVCS, claiming that it improves speed and is better for simultaneous collaboration on the same project. Furthermore, developers favor DVCS, making it necessary for technical writers to use them.

You can signup for GitHub.com account by following prompt in this [link](https://github.com/).

### 3. Create a New Repository on Github.

After creating the GitHub account you will have to create your first repository and name it accordingly make it public or private _(for this project I am making it public)_.

### 4. Adding files in your Repository.

After creating your repository you have to add your markdown resume `index.md` in this repository and add a commit message and then commit changes.

### 5. Add Jekyll theme on `index.md`.

We will use jekyll to add them to resume. To do that we will have to creat a new file called `_config.yml` to the repository. And add the followiung line of code in that file `theme: jekyll-theme-minimal`. This makes it easier to create a professional-looking website without having to manually design and style each page.

If you would like to choose differen theme nagivate to this https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/

### 6. Now we host it on GitHub Pages.

Now to host this on GitHuib Pages we need to make some changes in the setting of this repository. So follow the steps mentioned below:

1. Go to settings of the repository.
2. Click on to Pages.
3. Under branch section choose `main` as a branch.
4. Click save.
   **NOTE - Give it some time to process _(around 1 minute)_**

Hosted version of your resume can be seen on `https://yourusername.github.io/reponame` in general. For this repository `yourusername = jay-dodhiawala` and `reponame = markdown_resume` so the whole url looks like this `https://jay-dodhiawala.github.io/markdown_resume/` or [click here](https://jay-dodhiawala.github.io/markdown_resume/).

## FAQ.

#### 1. Why is Markdown better than a word processor?

According to Andrew Etter, "Documentation with any sort of lifespan needs to be kept in version control, which Word's DOCX file format (a compressed collection of XML files) actively opposes." Using Markdown helps two principles mentioned by etter in use

- To Deploy the documentation using a static site generator
- To Store the document under version control.

#### 2. Why is my resume not showing up?

According to Etter, "DVCS have better performance, allow for offline work, and are superior for concurrent work on the same file. For technical writers, the most importanct reason to use DVCS is that developer prefer them." Hence, the usability of DVCS can be proved in a long run where multiple users commit and update a project. DVCSC can handle that kind of structure and keep the documentation secure.
